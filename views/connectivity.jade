	p Huh. Error message. There was some interference. The connectivity code was not enough. We should probably fix that before going forward. Your security is my top priority.

	p Let’s try again. 

	p The link between our worlds is currently minor. It feeds off of energy and the energies in our worlds differ. We need to align the energies together by creating patterns and waves that are mirrored in both worlds. You will need to contribute your energies in order for this to work, while I'm doing the same thing here. We are in this together.

	p You need to  bring your fax machine’s connection onto the same wavelength as my fax machine. Essentially, you need to hack the server. You need to create a lightning-optic inter-reality formation device - or antenna - that transmits your connection beyond the barriers, rejecting authority, to open the divide that our fax machines have generated.

	p First, you need 1 piece of metal. This can be in whatever form, but it must not be fragile.
	p Next, you need 1 wire. The wire must have metal at both ends.
	p Go back to the fax machine.
	p Establish which side of your space takes you closer to the outside world.
	p Place one end of the wire 2cm from the opening of the Fax machine.
	p Place the other end of the wire towards the closest point of the outside world.
	p Connect the metal end closest to the outside world to the piece of metal.
	p Keep all non-antenna items clear from the antenna and fax.
	p The metal connection undoes the plasma screening surrounding the fax machine and pushes the fax machine’s domain through a vacuum tunnel out of this solar system and bypass the satellites that control us. This will need to be kept in place throughout the next steps. It's like a battery. The better connected, the better it will charge the vacuum tunnel.
